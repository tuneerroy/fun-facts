## How the Code Runs

We have developed a web app to allow users to interact with the game. Currently, both a paid and Sandbox MTurk HIT are published to collect initial data from the crowd.

### Web App

The web app is deployed at the following link: [https://fun-facts-2c47073e0b4e.herokuapp.com/](https://fun-facts-2c47073e0b4e.herokuapp.com/)

#### **Frontend**
- Built using **React**.
- Includes:
  - Login/registration pages.
  - A navigation bar at the top of the website.
  - Dedicated pages for:
    - The game itself.
    - A leaderboard displaying scores.
    - Fact/fiction submission.

#### **Backend**
- Built in **Python**.
- Integrates seamlessly with the frontend through well-structured backend files.
- Includes:
  - Required dependencies.
  - Sample inputs/outputs.
  - Base quality assurance (QA) and aggregation logic.

#### **Deployment**
- A GitHub Actions workflow (`deploy.yml`) automates the deployment process:
  - Installs frontend dependencies.
  - Builds the frontend.
  - Prepares the backend.
  - Displays the contents of `src/backend` for verification.
  - Deploys the app to Heroku.

### Analysis Plan

The analysis focuses on determining:
1. **Truthfulness Detection**:
   - Can users accurately identify if a statement is true or false?
   - This will be done by checking the crowd's responses against the verified fact/fiction they are voting on.
2. **AI Detection**:
   - For false statements, can users discern whether they were generated by AI?
   - This will also be determined by checking the crowd's responses against verified data.

Data collected from users undergoes:
1. **Quality Control**:
   - Handled in `quality_control.py`.
2. **Aggregation**:
   - Processed in `aggregation.py` to draw meaningful insights.
